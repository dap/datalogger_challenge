U. Penn N&T Hacker Challenge #2

Instructions from jorj:
=======================
You have an hour. Fastest time wins. The clock starts when I hand you
these rules.

The box I'm giving you is a datalogger. Given this thing, find out
where I was on Saturday, April 19th, 2003 at 17:22:36. Also determine
how fast I was moving.
